      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an engineer who has been working in IT for the past 25 years. My biggest passion is learning new technologies, and I believe there is no better way to cement that learning than by building and breaking things. I am also a strong believer in the strength of numbers and that collaboration helps grow ideas into bigger, more complete products.

        In my professional career, I am a strong supporter of pair programming as a way to share knowledge and learn from others. In times of crisis, a problem shared is a problem halved because, let’s be honest, breaking things (as mentioned above) is part and parcel of the building process.
